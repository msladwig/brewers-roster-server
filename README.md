# Brewers roster
This implementation of the Brewers roster project utilizes the fetch() functionality in JS.
To run this application: 
1. extract the zip file 
2. update the fetch() function in script.js to point to the correct URL for the hosted JSON file and save; currently set to point to './data.json' by default.
3. open brewersroster.html in the extracted brewers-roster-server folder.
4. click on a player name/row to view additional information, click again to close the expanded view.
